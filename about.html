                        My name is Marc Stogaitis, and I'm a principal engineer at Google with a passion for combining advanced technology with the fast-paced world of hockey. On the ice and behind the keyboard, I love exploring how machine learning and AI can deepen our understanding of the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my spare time I like to use machine learning and AI to do deep hockey analysis. I've built several ML tools to support that work, including a Deep Hockey Foundation model and vision models that track player positions on the ice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These machine learning tools let me work with massive amounts of game data so that I can look at many different examples and fully understand what's the right thing to do in a particular situation. By studying countless scenarios, I can compare patterns and evaluate decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Deep Hockey is where this work comes togetherâ€”a space to share what happens when you combine love for the sport with the power of AI.
